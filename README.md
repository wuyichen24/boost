A series of data structures to simulate the functional programming in Java (like Apache Spark JavaRRD).


## Overview
Originally, the Java is not supported for functional programming before Java 8 Lambda. 

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster-computing framework and it has as its architectural foundation the resilient distributed dataset (RDD). It is not only a read-only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines, 
but also it provides a smell of functional programming for manipulating a collection.

For this boost project, the functionality of clustering-computing has been removed and just keep the smell of smell of functional programming and the way for representing Map Reduce.
